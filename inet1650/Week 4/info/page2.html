<h2>Poem 1</h2>
<p>
<pre>   
    When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
   When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
   When the funds are low and the debts are high,
    And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
       When care is pressing you down a bit-
        Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
        
       Life is queer with its twists and turns,
        As every one of us sometimes learns,
            And many a fellow turns about
     When he might have won had he stuck it out.
      Don't give up though the pace seems slow -
          You may succeed with another blow.
          
            Often the goal is nearer than
       It seems to a faint and faltering man;
          Often the struggler has given up
     When he might have captured the victor's cup;
  And he learned too late when the night came down,
        How close he was to the golden crown.
        
        Success is failure turned inside out -
       The silver tint in the clouds of doubt,
      And you never can tell how close you are,
       It might be near when it seems afar;
    So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit -
  It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.

The great Overdog
That heavenly beast
With a star in one eye
Gives a leap in the east.
He dances upright
All the way to the west
And never once drops
On his forefeet to rest.
I'm a poor underdog,
But to-night I will bark
With the great Overdog
That romps through the dark.

-Robert Frost
